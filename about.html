      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Fountain Lake Network is a local news and community site for Fountain Lake,
        Arkansas and the surrounding area. Plain and simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        It exists because local stuff matters, and too often it gets ignored unless
        something goes wrong or someone from out of town decides it’s newsworthy.
        We’re here to keep people informed about what’s actually happening around here.
      </p>

      <p>
        No fluff. No drama. Just information people can use.
      </p>

      <h3>Why This Exists</h3>

      <p>
        If you live in a small community, you already know how this goes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things happen, people hear about it three different ways, and none of the details
        match. By the time anything shows up online, it’s either wrong, late, or buried
        under a bunch of unrelated noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fountain Lake Network exists to give locals one place to check for updates without
        digging through social media comments or rumor chains.
      </p>

      <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>

      <p>
        This site focuses on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Local news and incidents</li>
        <li>School-related updates</li>
        <li>Community events</li>
        <li>Area businesses</li>
        <li>Site announcements and notices</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some information comes from public sources. Some comes from people who live here.
        Everything is shared with the goal of being accurate and straightforward.
      </p>

      <p>
        If something changes or gets corrected, it’ll be updated. No pretending it didn’t happen.
      </p>

      <h3>How This Site Operates</h3>

      <p>
        This isn’t a political site. It isn’t sponsored content dressed up as news.
        And it isn’t built to chase clicks.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s independently run and focused on the community it serves. That’s it.
      </p>
