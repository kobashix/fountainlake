    <p>
      The Fountain Lake Network is a local-first news and information site created to
      serve the Fountain Lake, Arkansas community and surrounding areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is simple: provide clear, reliable updates on what matters locally —
      schools, events, public safety, businesses, and community announcements — without
      noise, algorithms, or clickbait.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Small communities are often underrepresented or misrepresented by regional and
      national outlets. Important local information gets buried, delayed, or ignored
      entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fountain Lake Network exists to fill that gap with timely, straightforward coverage
      that respects readers’ time and intelligence.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Cover</h2>

    <p>
      Coverage includes local news, school updates, events, business activity, and site
      announcements. Content may come from original reporting, public information, and
      verified community submissions.
    </p>

    <h2>Independence & Transparency</h2>

    <p>
      This site is independently operated. There are no political affiliations, no
      sponsored narratives, and no engagement-driven sensationalism.
    </p>

    <p>
      If something is corrected or updated, it will be done clearly and openly.
